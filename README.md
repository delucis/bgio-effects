> 📤 Helpers for managing state effects in [boardgame.io][bgio].

This package provides a structured approach to triggering ephemeral “effects”
in game code that can be consumed from state on the client. It provides a game
plugin and a client-side extension that emits events for your effects.

## 💾 Installation

```sh
npm i bgio-effects
```

## 👀 At a glance

Call effects from your moves or other game code:

```js
function move({ G, effects }) {
  effects.explode();
}
```

Listen for effects on the client:

```js
const onExplode = () => {
  // render explosion/play sound/etc.
};

// With the plain JS emitter
emitter.on("explode", onExplode);

// With the React hook
useEffectListener("explode", onExplode, []);
```
