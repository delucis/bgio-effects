> 📤 Helpers for managing state effects in [boardgame.io][bgio].

This package provides a structured approach to triggering ephemeral “effects”
in game code that can be consumed from state on the client. It provides a game
plugin and a client-side extension that emits events for your effects.


## Installation

```sh
npm i bgio-effects
```


## At a glance

Call effects from your moves or other game code:

```js
function move(G, ctx) {
  ctx.effects.explode();
}
```

Listen for effects on the client:

```js
const onExplode = () => {
  // render explosion/play sound/etc.
};

// With the plain JS emitter
emitter.on('explode', onExplode);

// With the React hook
useEffectListener('explode', onExplode, []);
```

### Plugin

#### Configuration

The `bgio-effects` plugin needs a configuration object. This object configures
the effects that will be available to your game logic.

```js
// effects-config.js

export const config = {
  // Declare the effect types you need.
  effects: {
    // Each effect is named by its key.
    // This creates a zero-config endTurn effect:
    endTurn: {},

    rollDie: {
      // Effects can declare a `create` function.
      // If defined, the return value of create will be
      // available as the payload for an effect.
      create: (value) => ({ value }),

      // Effects can declare a default duration in seconds
      // (see “Sequencing effects” below).
      duration: 2,
    },
  },
};
```

#### Adding the plugin to your game

To use the plugin, include it in your game definition’s `plugins` array,
passing it your configuration object:

```js
// game.js

import { EffectsPlugin } from 'bgio-effects/plugin';
import { config } from './effects-config';

const game = {
  name: 'my-game',

  plugins: [EffectsPlugin(config)],

  // Each effect type declared in your config will
  // be available in your moves as ctx.effects[effectType]
  moves: {
    roll: (G, ctx) => {
      G.roll = ctx.random.D6();
      ctx.effects.rollDie(G.roll);
      if (G.roll > 4) ctx.effects.explode();
    },

    end: (G, ctx) => {
      ctx.events.endTurn();
      ctx.effects.endTurn();
    },
  },
};
```

#### Sequencing effects

You can add timing information to your effects to sequence them on the client.
By default, effects have a duration of `0` and are added to the end of the
timeline in the order they are called, which means they will all trigger
together as soon as the game state updates.

You can set an alternative default duration for each effect in its
config object:

```js
{
  effects: {
    longEffect: {
      duration: 5,
    },
  },
}
```

Now an effect called after `longEffect` will be added to the timeline
5 seconds after `longEffect` by default. For example:

```
0  .  .  .  .  5  .  .  .  .  10
↑              ↑
longEffect     nextEffect
```

You can also specify where an effect is placed on the timeline and override its
default duration when calling it, by passing position and duration parameters:

```js
effect(position, duration);
effectWithCreateFn(createArg, position, duration);
```

- ##### `position`

  - **type:** `string` | `number`
  - **default:** `'>'` (end of the timeline)

  Specifies the placement of this effect on the timeline.

  A number places the effect at an absolute time, e.g. `3` would place the
  effect at 3 seconds along the timeline.

  A string is parsed according to a terse syntax for expressing different
  placements along the timeline:

  - `'>'`: Relative to the end of the timeline, for example:

    - `'>+1'`: 1 second after the end of the timeline

    - `'>-1'`: 1 second before the end of the timeline

  - `'<'`: Relative to the start of the last effect on the timeline,
    for example:

    - `'<'`: Aligned with the start of the last effect on the timeline

    - `'<+0.1'`: 0.1 seconds after the start of the last effect on the timeline

  - `'^'`: Insert at an absolute time and shift all subsequent effects in time,
    for example:

    - `'^3'`: Insert at 3 seconds and shift subsequent effects by this effect’s
      duration

    - `'^3->0.5'`: Insert at 3 seconds and shift subsequent effects by
      0.5 seconds

- ##### `duration`

  - **type:** `number`
  - **default:** `0` or `duration` in the effect’s config if set

  A time in seconds to override the effect’s default duration.

##### Example

The following effects create the following timeline.

```js
A(0, 4);    // add A at 0s, with a duration of 4s
B('>-1', 1);// add B 1s before the end of the timeline, i.e. at 3s
C('^2->1'); // add C at 2s, shift later effects by 1s
D('^0', 5); // add D at 0s, shift later effects by its duration (5s)
E('<');     // add E, aligning it with start of last effect
```

```
0  .  .  .  .  5  .  ₇  .  ₉  10
↑              ↑     ↑     ↑
D              A     C    B+E
```

### With a plain JS client

#### `EffectsEmitter`

`EffectsEmitter` wraps a boardgame.io client, returning an API that allows you
to subscribe to specific effects as well as the latest boardgame.io state.

To create an emitter instance, pass your boardgame.io client to
`EffectsEmitter`:

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';
import { EffectsEmitter } from 'bgio-effects/client';

const client = Client({ /* game, etc. */ });
const emitter = EffectsEmitter(client);
client.start();
```

##### Options

In addition to passing `EffectsEmitter` the boardgame.io client, you can pass
an options object to configure the effects behaviour.

```js
const emitter = EffectsEmitter(client, {
  // Delay updating emitter.state until after the
  // last effect has been triggered.
  // Default: false
  updateStateAfterEffects: true,

  // Global control of the speed of effect playback.
  // Default: 1
  speed: 1,
});
```

#### `EffectsEmitter#on()`

##### Parameters

1. Effect Type (`string`) — the effect you want to listen for.

2. Callback (`function`) — the function to run when the effect is fired.

4. _(optional)_ On-End Callback (`function`) — a function to run when the effect
   ends (as defined by the effect’s `duration`).

##### Returns

An unsubscribe callback.

##### Usage

Call your emitter instance’s `on` method to listen for effect events.

```js
// Subscribe to the “effectName” effect.
const unsubscribe = emitter.on('effectName', (effectPayload, bgioState) => {});

// When you want to stop listening for this effect,
// call the returned unsubscribe callback.
unsubscribe();
```

`effectPayload` will be the data returned by your `create` function or
`undefined` for effects without a `create` function.

`bgioState` will be the latest state passed by boardgame.io. This is particularly useful when using the `updateStateAfterEffects` option to get early access to the new global state.

##### Special Events

You can listen for _all_ effects using the special `'*'` wildcard. In this case,
your callback receives both the effect name and payload:

```js
emitter.on('*', (effectName, effectPayload, boardProps) => {});
```

Two other special events will also always be fired:

- `'effects:start'` will fire before any other effects.

- `'effects:end'` will fire after all the effects in the queue have completed.

##### Example

```js
const dice = document.querySelector('#dice');

const onRollStart = () => dice.classList.add('animated');
const onRollEnd = () =>  dice.classList.remove('animated');

emitter.on('rollDie', onRollStart, onRollEnd);
```

#### `EffectsEmitter#state`

An emitter instance has a `state` property which is a store you can subscribe
to that mirrors boardgame.io’s state. The only difference between subscribing
to `EffectsEmitter#state` and subscribing directly to the boardgame.io client
is that `EffectsEmitter#state` delays updating if you set the
`updateStateAfterEffects` option to `true` when creating the emitter.

##### Usage

Subscribe to state updates:

```js
// Instead of client.subscribe((state) => {}), use this:
const unsubscribe = emitter.state.subscribe((state) => {});
```

Or get the current state:

```js
// Instead of client.getState(), use this:
const state = emitter.state.get();
```

#### Queue API

`EffectsEmitter` instances also expose an API to allow direct control of the
effect queue if necessary.

- `EffectsEmitter#clear()`: Cancel any currently queued effects from being fired.
- `EffectsEmitter#flush()`: Immediately trigger any currently queued effects.
- `EffectsEmitter#size`: A subscribable store containing the number of effects
  currently queued.

##### Usage

```js
const clearButton = document.querySelector('button#clear');
clearButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  emitter.clear();
});

const flushButton = document.querySelector('button#flush');
flushButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  emitter.flush();
});

const queueSizeEl = document.querySelector('#queue-size');
emitter.size.subscribe((size) => {
  queueSizeEl.textContent = 'Queue size: ' + size;
});
```

### With a React client

The provided React component wrapper and hooks allow you to consume your effects
as events, emitting them over time if you used the effect sequencing features.

#### `EffectsBoardWrapper`

To include the core effects engine in your app, wrap your board component with
the `EffectsBoardWrapper` before passing it to the boardgame.io client factory:

```js
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/react';
import { EffectsBoardWrapper } from 'bgio-effects/react';
import { BoardComponent } from './Board';

const board = EffectsBoardWrapper(BoardComponent);
const BGIOClient = Client({ board, /* game, etc. */ });
```

##### Options

In addition to passing `EffectsBoardWrapper` your board component, you can also
pass an options object to configure the effects behaviour.

```js
const board = EffectsBoardWrapper(BoardComponent, {
  // Delay passing the updated boardgame.io state to your board
  // until after the last effect has been triggered.
  // Default: false
  updateStateAfterEffects: true,

  // Global control of the speed of effect playback.
  // Default: 1
  speed: 1,
});
```

#### `useEffectListener`

##### Parameters

1. Effect Type (`string`) — the effect you want to listen for.

2. Callback (`function`) — the function to run when the effect is fired.

3. Dependencies (`array`) — an array of variables your callback depends upon (similar to [React’s `useCallback` hook][useCallback]).

4. _(optional)_ On-End Callback (`function`) — a function to run when the effect
   ends (as defined by the effect’s `duration`).

5. _(optional)_ On-End Dependencies (`array`) — an array of variables your
   on-end callback depends on.

##### Usage

Within your board component or child components, use the `useEffectListener`
hook to listen for effect events:

```js
import { useEffectListener } from 'bgio-effects/react';

function Component() {
  useEffectListener('effectName', (effectPayload, boardProps) => {}, []);
  return <div/>;
}
```

`effectPayload` will be the data returned by your `create` function or
`undefined` for effects without a `create` function.

`boardProps` will be the latest props passed by boardgame.io. This is particularly useful when using the `updateStateAfterEffects` option to get early access to the new global state.

Your callback can return a clean-up function, which will be run the next time the effect is fired, if the variables in the dependency array change, or if the component unmounts. This is similar to [cleaning up in React’s `useEffect` hook][cleanup].

##### Special Events

You can listen for _all_ effects using the special `'*'` wildcard. In this case,
your callback receives both the effect name and payload:

```js
useEffectListener('*', (effectName, effectPayload, boardProps) => {}, []);
```

Two other special events will also always be fired:

- `'effects:start'` will fire before any other effects.

- `'effects:end'` will fire after all the effects in the queue have completed.

##### Example

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useEffectListener } from 'bgio-effects/react';

function DiceComponent() {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);

  // Subscribe to the “rollDie” effect type:
  useEffectListener(
    // Name of the effect to listen for.
    'rollDie',
    // Function to call when the effect fires.
    () => {
      setAnimate(true);
      const timeout = window.setTimeout(() => setAnimate(false), 1000);
      // Return a clean-up function to cancel the timeout.
      return () => window.clearTimeout(timeout);
    },
    // Dependency array of variables the callback uses.
    [setAnimate]
  );

  return <div className={animate ? 'animated' : 'static'} />;
}
```

#### `useEffectState`

The `useEffectState` hook provides an abstraction around `useEffectListener`
for cases where you don’t need to call other imperative code
when an effect fires.

##### Parameters

1. Effect Type (`string`) — the effect you want to observe state for.

2. _(optional)_ Initial State (`any`) — a value to use for `state` before
   an effect is received.

##### Returns

A `[state, isActive]` tuple.

- `state`: The latest value for this effect type.
  This will be `undefined` until the effect fires.
- `isActive`: A boolean indicating whether the effect is currently active.

##### Usage

```js
import { useEffectState } from 'bgio-effects/react';

function Component() {
  const [roll, isRolling] = useEffectState('rollDie', 1);
  const className = isRolling ? 'animated' : 'static';
  return <div className={className}>{roll}</div>;
}
```

#### `useLatestPropsOnEffect`

When using the `updateStateAfterEffects` option, you may run into situations
where you have components that need the latest boardgame.io props *before* the
global props get updated. This hook allows you to get the latest props early
when the specified effects fire.

##### Parameters

One or more effect types that should cause the props to update.

##### Returns

The [boardgame.io board props][bgio-props].

##### Usage

```js
import { useLatestPropsOnEffect } from 'bgio-effects/react';

function Component() {
  const { G, ctx } = useLatestPropsOnEffect('rollDie', 'endTurn');
  return <div>{G.roll}</div>;
}
```

This also works with [the special events](#special-events). For example,
in a component that needs the latest props as soon as they are available:

```js
const { G, ctx } = useLatestPropsOnEffect('effects:start');
```

#### `useEffectQueue`

##### Usage

The `useEffectQueue` hook lets child components control the effect queue if necessary:

```js
import { useEffectQueue } from 'bgio-effects/react';

function Component() {
  const { clear, flush, size } = useEffectQueue();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Queue Size: {size}</p>
      <button onClick={clear}>Clear</button>
      <button onClick={flush}>Flush</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### Returns

`useEffectQueue` returns the following methods and properties:

- `clear()`: Cancel any currently queued effects from being fired.
- `flush()`: Immediately trigger any currently queued effects.
- `size`: The number of effects currently queued.

### Timing precision

This library is not designed with highly precise timing and animation
synchronisation in mind. Effects are emitted from a `requestAnimationFrame`
callback and the general implementation aims to be as performant and simple as
possible. Exact timing will depend on the frame rate of a user’s browser and
the accuracy of `Date.now()` (which may be limited for security reasons).
